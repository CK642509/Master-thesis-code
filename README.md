To speed up data processing, Python and ImageJ macro are applied. Python is utililized for data processing, including SERS spectrum data pretreatment and statistic analysis. ImageJ macro is utilized for selecting region of interest, including microwells and channels, and analyzation after the regions are selected. Here, the instructions of Python code and ImageJ macro code are written below.

## Python
### 1_delete two column
The SERS spectrum is debaselined by a software written by Prof. Wangâ€™ lab, which has to input data with correct data structure. However, in SERS mapping, the recorded spectrum includes position information. It recorded the x,y position at first two column. Therefore, these two columns have to be removed before import into the debaseline software. 

### 2_put txt to excel
The output of debaseline software is a text file with single debaselined spectrum. However, for each experiments, there will be lots of SERS spectra. Combining these text file together for further statistic analyzation is needed. Also, the average and standard deviation of SERS spectra are also calculated after combining the text files. They are recorded at last two column. Only the text files in same folder, which has the same experiment condition, are combined.

### 3_put last two column together
After the average and standard deviation of SERS spectra are calculated, these spectrum should be plotted to compare with each other. Therefore, extracting the average and standard deviation from each experiment conditions is needed.

## ImageJ
### Flourescence image (gradient and beads)
First, select the four corner of the microwell array or channel array. Second provide number of column, row, circle diameter or rectangular height and width. Third, generate the regions of interest. Forth, start analyzing each microwell or channel. This analyzation can be calculating the average fluorescence intensity or the number of beads. Finally, fill the regions of interest with different color for heatmap if needed.

### SERS imaging
Get all the intensity of 733 cm-1 peak and save in a text file. Then, the ImageJ macro will open the and turn it into a SERS image.

### SERS-AST
